# Montecarlo simulations of the stock market (SP500) using python.

This notebook is an excuse to learn about Montecarlo simulations in python. I have used dedicated software (GPSS) which is horrible and hides a lot of the details.

Use at your own risk or for your own enjoyment. I did it for myself, if you like it and clone it or fork it, please let me know. I don't own any rights, I would just like to know about any cool thing that you are doing.

Maybe one day I expand this to make a more realistic portfolio and refine some assumptions if time allows.
